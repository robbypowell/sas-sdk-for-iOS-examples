#  SASKit-Samples
SASKit-Samples are XCode projects that demonstrate using the SASKit framework enabling iOS developers to build customized apps that include content from [SASÂ® Visual Analytics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/visual-analytics.html).


## Getting SASKit Framework
Access the SASKit installer (SASKit.pkg) from the [developer.sas.com Mobile SDK site](https://developer.sas.com/guides/mobile-sdk.html). This site also includes access to the [SASKit Documentation](https://developer.sas.com/sdk/mobile/iOS/doc/8.22/). Upon running the installation the SASKit framework is installed in "/Library/Frameworks".

For information, advice, and questions on the use of SAS Mobile SDKs please start with the [SAS Visual Analytics online community](https://communities.sas.com/Visual-Analytics).


## Open XCode Workspace
Once the SASKit framework is installed you can open SASKit-Samples.xcworkspace in XCode and build each of the projects to run on device simulators right away.

In order to build for a physical device, the bundle ID for the projects need to be changed from "com.your-domain.<appname>" to use the domain specified in your developer account.  Wildcard apps (com.your-domain.*) or specific apps for each of the samples (com.your-domain.<appname>) can be set up at developer.apple.com under your organizations' developer account.  Also, the signing ID for the projects will need to be configured in order to build to run on a device.


## Apps

### [SASKitCustomApp](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-sdk-for-iOS-examples/tree/master/SASKitCustomApp)
This sample wraps the SAS Mobile BI app to create a custom application. This is a good starting point only requiring a few lines of code, and demonstrates deriving an application delegate from the provided SASApplicationDelegate.

### [SASKitFullscreen](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-sdk-for-iOS-examples/tree/master/SASKitFullscreen)
This sample demonstrates deriving an application delegate from SASManagerDelegate, connecting to a predetermined server, and displaying a report in full screen.

### [SASKitMasterDetail](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-sdk-for-iOS-examples/tree/master/SASKitMasterDetail)
This sample demonstrates showing multiple reports that are maintained in a list and can be selected and displayed full screen.
